In the following questions, write the codes directed and copy and paste them into this document which you will then submit. Do not use native Julia methods (factor, lcm, gcd). 

1.	Write a program in Julia that prints all the factors of a positive integer supplied by the user.

function get_factors(n)
    for i in 1:(n/2)
        if n%i == 0 
            print(i)
            print(" ")
            println(n/i)
        end
    end
end


2.	Write a program in Julia that finds the Greatest Common Denominator of any two positive integers.

function get_gcd(x, y)
    if x ==y
        return x
    end
        
    gcd = 1
    for i in 1:min(x, y, min(x, y, abs(x-y)))
        if x%i == 0 & y%i == 0
            gcd = i
        end
    end
    return gcd
end

3.	Write a program in Julia that finds the Least Common Multiple of any two positive integers.

function get_lcm(x, y)
    return (x*y)/get_gcd(x, y)
end


function generate_lcm(x,y)
    greater = max(x,y)
    lcm =1
   while(true)
       if((greater % x == 0) && (greater % y == 0))
           lcm = greater
           break
        end
       greater += 1
    end
   return lcm
end
